## ðŸ“Š **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Schema Design**
```sql
Academic Schema:
â”œâ”€â”€ subjects (Subject management with grade levels)
â”œâ”€â”€ curricula (Learning objectives and outcomes)
â”œâ”€â”€ periods (Class time slots)
â”œâ”€â”€ timetables (Class scheduling with conflict detection)
â”œâ”€â”€ attendance_sessions (Session tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ attendance_records (Individual student attendance)
â”œâ”€â”€ assessments (Tests, quizzes, assignments)
â”œâ”€â”€ grades (Student performance with auto-calculation)
â”œâ”€â”€ lesson_plans (Teacher planning with templates)
â””â”€â”€ calendar_events (Academic calendar management)
```

### **API Endpoint Coverage**
```yaml

  - POST /api/v1/academic/subjects
  - GET /api/v1/academic/subjects
  - GET /api/v1/academic/subjects/{id}
  - PUT /api/v1/academic/subjects/{id}

- **Three-Term System**: Automatic term calculation based on dates
- **Grading Scale**: A (80-100%), B (70-79%), C (60-69%), D (50-59%), E (40-49%), U (<40%)
- **Subject Classifications**: Core subjects (English, Math, Science) vs Optional subjects
- **Practical Requirements**: Lab booking and resource management for practical subjects
- **Language Support**: Course delivery in English, Shona, or Ndebele

## ðŸ“‹ **HANDOFF TO FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT**

### **Ready API Endpoints**
All Academic Management APIs are ready for frontend consumption:

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/academic`

**Key Endpoints for Frontend**:
1. **Subject Management**: Full CRUD operations
2. **Timetable Display**: Class schedules and teacher assignments
3. **Attendance Tracking**: Bulk attendance marking
4. **Assessment Creation**: Test and quiz management
5. **Grade Entry**: Bulk grade submission
6. **Dashboard Data**: Statistics and analytics

### **Frontend Components Needed**
1. **SubjectManagement** - Subject CRUD with grade level selection
2. **TimetableView** - Weekly/daily timetable display with conflict detection
3. **AttendanceTracker** - Class attendance marking interface
4. **AssessmentCreator** - Assessment creation wizard
5. **GradeEntry** - Bulk grade entry with auto-calculation
6. **TeacherDashboard** - Personal teacher analytics
7. **AcademicDashboard** - School-wide academic statistics
8. **CurriculumPlanner** - Learning objectives and outcomes management

### **Zimbabwe-Specific UI Requirements**
- **Three-Term Selector**: Term 1, 2, 3 with date ranges
- **Grade Level Picker**: 1-7 (Primary), Form 1-6 (Secondary)
- **Language Selector**: English, Shona, Ndebele
- **Subject Classification**: Visual distinction between Core and Optional
- **Grading Display**: Zimbabwe letter grades with percentage ranges

## ðŸŽ¯ **INTEGRATION WITH SIS MODULE**

### **Data Relationships**
- **Students**: Academic module uses student_id from SIS module
- **Classes**: Timetables reference class_id from SIS module  
- **Teachers**: Teacher assignments use teacher_id from user management
- **Academic Years**: Shared academic year concepts across modules

### **Planned Integration Points**
1. **Student Performance**: Link grades to student profiles
2. **Class Lists**: Populate attendance from SIS class enrollment
3. **Report Cards**: Generate academic reports using SIS + Academic data
4. **Parent Portal**: Show academic progress in parent dashboard

---

## ðŸš€ **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

The Academic Management Module is **ready for immediate integration** with:
- Complete backend API implementation
- Zimbabwe education system compliance
- Multi-tenant architecture support
- Production-grade error handling and validation
- Comprehensive test framework

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Begin frontend component development using existing SIS patterns
2. Integrate Academic APIs with React Query (following SIS implementation)
3. Create Academic Management navigation in existing app structure
4. Implement teacher role permissions for academic features
5. Test integration with SIS module data

## ðŸ“ˆ **PROJECT MOMENTUM**

- **Modules Completed**: 3/39 (Foundation + SIS + Academic Management)
- **Current Velocity**: Excellent progress with established patterns
- **Phase 1 Progress**: 50% complete (3/6 core modules)
- **Overall Progress**: ~8% (solid architectural foundation)
- **Risk Level**: LOW (proven patterns and successful integrations)

**The OneClass platform now has comprehensive Student Information System AND Academic Management capabilities, providing a complete foundation for Zimbabwe school operations.**
