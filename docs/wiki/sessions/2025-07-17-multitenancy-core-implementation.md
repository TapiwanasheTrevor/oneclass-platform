  - `platform.schools` table with basic school information
  - `platform.users` table with school-scoped user management
  - `academic.academic_years` and `academic.classes` tables
  - Proper indexes, constraints, and sample data
  - Basic RLS policies for data isolation

### 2. **Enhanced Platform Schema**

- **Status**: ✅ Complete  
- **Description**: Implemented full multitenancy enhancements from the plan
- **Components**:
  - `platform.school_configurations` with branding, features, and settings
  - `platform.school_domains` for subdomain support
  - `platform.school_feature_usage` for analytics and billing
  - Enhanced user context with school role management
  - Comprehensive RLS policies for school isolation
  - Utility functions for configuration management

### 3. **Enhanced Authentication System**
- **File**: `backend/shared/auth.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Description**: Full authentication system with school context
- **Components**:
  - `EnhancedUser` model with complete school context
  - `SchoolConfiguration` and `SchoolDomain` models
  - JWT token management with school isolation
  - Role-based permissions system
  - Feature-based access control decorators
  - Database connection management
  - User authentication and authorization

### 4. **School-Isolated File Storage**
- **File**: `backend/shared/file_storage.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Description**: Complete file storage system with school isolation
- **Components**:
  - S3 backend with local storage fallback for development
  - School-isolated file paths and access control
  - File validation (type, size, permissions)
  - Convenience functions for common file types
  - Storage usage tracking and analytics
  - Secure file access with presigned URLs

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### **Database Schema Hierarchy**
```
platform/
├── schools (basic school info)
├── users (school-scoped users)
├── school_configurations (branding, features, settings)
├── school_domains (subdomain support)
└── school_feature_usage (analytics)

academic/
├── academic_years (school-specific years)
└── classes (school-specific classes)

sis/
├── students (references platform tables)
├── student_guardians
├── student_academic_history
├── disciplinary_incidents
├── health_records
├── attendance_records
└── student_documents
```

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User provides JWT token
2. Token validated and user ID extracted
3. Full user context loaded with school configuration
4. Permissions and features determined by role and subscription
5. School-isolated access enforced via RLS policies

### **File Storage Architecture**
```
Storage Structure:
schools/{school_id}/
├── students/{student_id}/
│   ├── documents/
│   └── photos/
├── branding/logos/
├── reports/{report_type}/
└── {category}/{subfolder}/
```

## 🔧 Technical Configuration

### **Environment Variables Required**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/oneclass

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# File Storage (S3)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=oneclass-files
CDN_BASE_URL=https://cdn.oneclass.app

# Development Storage
USE_LOCAL_STORAGE=true
LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=./storage
```

### **Database Setup Commands**
```bash
# Run in order:
psql -d oneclass -f database/schemas/00_platform_foundation.sql
psql -d oneclass -f database/schemas/01_platform_enhanced.sql
psql -d oneclass -f database/schemas/09_sis_simple.sql
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3-4: Frontend Integration)

1. **Frontend School Context Hook**
   - File: `frontend/src/hooks/useSchoolContext.ts`
   - Implement school context provider for React
   - Add feature and permission access hooks

2. **School Theming Provider**
   - File: `frontend/src/components/providers/SchoolThemeProvider.tsx`
   - Dynamic branding and theming system
   - School logo and color customization

3. **Feature-Gated Components**
   - Create components that respect subscription tiers
   - Implement upgrade prompts and limits

4. **Enhanced SIS Integration**
   - Update SIS backend to use enhanced auth
   - Add school context to all SIS operations

## 📊 Progress Status

**Week 1-2 Core Infrastructure**: ✅ **100% Complete**
- ✅ Enhanced Platform Schema
- ✅ Enhanced Authentication Context  
- ✅ School-Isolated File Storage
