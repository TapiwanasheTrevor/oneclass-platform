Perfect! Let me create comprehensive user onboarding journeys that showcase the power of your multi-tenant architecture with school memberships. This will demonstrate how 1Class handles complex real-world scenarios elegantly.## üéØ **Key User Onboarding Insights**

I've created comprehensive user journey flows that showcase how 1Class handles Zimbabwe's complex educational scenarios with elegance. Here are the critical insights:

## **üèÜ Multi-Tenant Architecture Advantages:**

### **1. Single Identity, Multiple Contexts**
- **Teachers**: One account across multiple schools (common in Zimbabwe)
- **Parents**: Track children at different schools seamlessly  
- **Students**: Academic history follows them during transfers
- **Administrators**: Can manage multiple campuses efficiently

### **2. Intelligent Duplicate Detection**
- System recognizes existing users when invited to new schools
- No duplicate accounts - just additional school memberships
- Maintains data integrity across the platform

### **3. Role-Based Context Switching**
- Sarah Moyo example: Teacher at St. Mary's + Parent at 3 schools
- Different permissions and data access per role/school
- Automatic context switching via subdomain routing

## **üöÄ Real-World Zimbabwe Scenarios Handled:**

### **Complex Family Dynamics**
- **Multi-school families**: Children at different institutions
- **Parent-teacher conflicts**: Special handling when parent teaches their child
- **Extended family**: Grandparents, guardians with different access levels

### **Staff Mobility**
- **Part-time teachers**: Working at multiple schools
- **Transfer staff**: Moving between institutions with history preservation
- **Substitute teachers**: Temporary access management

### **Institutional Changes**
- **School mergers**: Automatic account consolidation
- **Campus expansions**: Multi-location management
- **Franchise models**: District-wide user management

## **üí° Technical Implementation Highlights:**

### **Onboarding Flow Features:**
```typescript
// Automatic school membership assignment
if (signupViaSubdomain) {
  user.school_memberships.push({
    school_id: extractSchoolFromSubdomain(subdomain),
    role: determineDefaultRole(invitationContext),
    auto_assigned: true
  });
}

// Duplicate detection and linking
if (existingUser = findByEmail(email)) {
  existingUser.addSchoolMembership(newSchool, newRole);
  sendMembershipAddedNotification();
} else {
  createNewUserWithSchoolMembership();
}
```

### **Context-Aware UI:**
- **Subdomain routing**: `stmarys.oneclass.ac.zw` vs `chitungwiza-primary.oneclass.ac.zw`
- **Role indicators**: Clear visual distinction between teacher/parent modes
- **School switcher**: Dropdown for users with multiple memberships

## **üéØ Zimbabwe-Specific Benefits:**

### **Cultural Considerations:**
- **Extended family involvement**: Multiple guardians per child supported
- **Community connections**: Teachers often live in school communities
- **Economic factors**: Siblings may attend different schools based on fees

### **Practical Advantages:**
- **Mobile-first design**: Most users access via smartphones
- **Offline capability**: Works with intermittent internet
- **Local payment integration**: EcoCash, Paynow support
- **Multi-currency support**: USD and ZWL handling

This comprehensive onboarding system positions 1Class as the **only school management platform** in Zimbabwe that truly understands and handles the complex, interconnected nature of the country's educational ecosystem! üèÜ

The multi-tenant architecture doesn't just manage schools - it **manages relationships, contexts, and the real-world complexity** of how education actually works in Zimbabwe.
