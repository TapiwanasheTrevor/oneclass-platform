## Testing Strategy

### Current Status
❌ **Comprehensive tests need to be implemented**

### Required Test Coverage
1. **Backend Tests**
   - Unit tests for CRUD operations
   - Integration tests for payment flows
   - API endpoint testing
   - Database schema validation
   - Paynow integration testing

2. **Frontend Tests**
   - Component unit tests
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - API client testing
   - Accessibility testing
   - Mobile responsiveness testing

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Partitioning for large transaction tables
- Query optimization for reporting
- Connection pooling configured

### Frontend Performance
- Code splitting for large components
- Lazy loading for heavy operations
- React Query caching strategies
- Optimized bundle sizes

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required for Paynow integration
PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_ID=your_integration_id
PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_KEY=your_integration_key
PAYNOW_RETURN_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payment-return
PAYNOW_RESULT_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payment-webhook
```

### Database Migrations
- Run `database/schemas/10_finance.sql` in production
- Ensure proper RLS policies are applied
- Verify multitenancy isolation

## Known Limitations

1. **Reporting Limitations**
   - Advanced analytics dashboard not implemented
   - Custom report builder not available
   - Historical trend analysis basic

2. **Payment Integration**
   - Limited to Paynow for Zimbabwe
   - International payment gateways not integrated
   - Cryptocurrency payments not supported

3. **Mobile App**
   - Parent mobile app not implemented
   - Mobile-specific payment flows needed
   - Push notifications not configured

## Next Steps for Continued Development

### High Priority
1. **Implement comprehensive test suite** (backend and frontend)
2. **Add advanced financial analytics** and reporting
3. **Implement parent mobile app** integration
4. **Add international payment gateways** (Stripe, PayPal)
5. **Enhance audit trails** and compliance features

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement payment plans** and installment management
2. **Add financial forecasting** and budgeting tools
3. **Integrate with accounting systems** (QuickBooks, Xero)
4. **Add automated reminders** and collections workflow
5. **Implement scholarship** and financial aid management

### Low Priority
1. **Add cryptocurrency payment** support
2. **Implement multi-currency** support
3. **Add advanced fraud detection**

- Validate user permissions for cross-school access

### 3. Zimbabwe-Specific Considerations
- Implement local validation rules
- Support local currencies and formats
- Consider regulatory compliance requirements
- Add local payment method support

### 4. Quality Standards
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
